Fungal disease has devastated plants and animals for millennia, starting from biblical plagues. A pathogen's success depends on its genetic adaptability, including traits like mutation and horizontal gene transfer: these processes can lead to new effectors, proteins that help pathogens suppress host defences. I first identified fungal effector genes through comparative genomics and subsequently found several up-regulated in infection, alongside resistance proteins in the plant hosts.

Right: Strains of <i>Fusarium xylarioides</i>, the coffee wilt disease pathogen, are differentiated by pigmentation on carrot agar: the population infecting robusta coffee are orange; the population infecting arabica coffee are white. The two strains are incompatible, as shown by the absence of perithecia (fruiting bodies) along the contact zones (Photograph © P. Lepoint and H. Maraite).
