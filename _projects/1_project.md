Many species are suffering due to climate change. In California, over 10 million trees (20% of forest cover) died between 2013-15 from drought and wildfire. Understanding the biological processes for short- and long-term responses to climate is crucial. Locally adapted populations respond to new conditions with changes in stress-related gene expression. I study short- and long-term environmental stress response in the Sork lab, using California oaks to explore genetics, epigenetics, regulatory mechanisms and physiological responses at a molecular and population scale. Previously, I used transcriptomics to analyze coffee plants’ response to fungal pathogens.
