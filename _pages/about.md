Hello! 

I am an evolutionary genomicist at the Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California Los Angeles, working with Victoria Sork. I received my PhD in Evolutionary Biology from Imperial College London, supervised by Tim Barraclough and Matthew Ryan at the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences (CABI). 

My broad interests are in the ecology and adaptation of natural populations of plants and fungi. I use whole-genome, methylome, and transcriptome sequence data along with population genomics and comparative phylogenetic approaches to better understand how these processes contribute to evolutionary change. I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar working on genetic and epigenetic responses of tree populations to climate change. In my PhD, I used cryogenically preserved living isolates to track fungal evolution over a timescale of decades. In my free time I swim in the Pacific ocean and run in the coastal hills.
