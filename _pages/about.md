Hello! 

I am an evolutionary biologist at the Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California Los Angeles, working with Victoria Sork. I received my PhD in Evolutionary Biology from Imperial College London, supervised by Tim Barraclough and Matthew Ryan at the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences (CABI). 

My research addresses questions in evolutionary genomics. Specifically, I study the genetic mechanisms by which organisms adapt to environmental change, such as a warming climate, disease, or anthropogenic-induced landscape changes. In my free time I like to be in nature, swimming and surfing in the Pacific ocean and running in the coastal hills.
