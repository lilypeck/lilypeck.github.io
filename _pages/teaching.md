- **Summer 2025:** Went to Botany 2025 in Palm Springs with the other members of the Sork lab, where we all either presented a poster or gave a talk üôåüèº. Was inspired by some amazing work ranging from carbon transport in leaves to pangenomes, and gave two talks myself. 

- **Summer 2025:** Listened to some fab undergraduate posters and talks at the UCLA EEB research day. I was lucky enough to be a judge and had the difficult decision of scoring each poster! I also gave a ‚ö°Ô∏è talk about my work on stress response in oaks. 

- **Spring 2025:** Returned to the UC Sedgwick reserve to collect another set of leaf morphology and physiology data on burned and unburned valley oak trees

- **Spring 2025:** Invited to give a talk about my work on oak responses to wildfire at a research symposium jointly organized by the Point Conception Institute and the La Kretz Center here in California

- **Winter 2025:** With the help of UCLA undergrads, measured, planted and counted germination of hundreds of acorns üå± 

- **Autumn 2024:** Began mentoring five UCLA undergrads in a research project looking at the fecundity effects of the Lake Wildfire on valley oak 

- **Autumn 2024:** [New paper published in PLOS Biology](https://plos.io/4gnYTVk) which uses historic strains of the coffee wilt disease pathogen to show that host specificity and disease were driven by serial horizontal transfer events. All analyses, scripts, and code are on [<i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/lilypeck/fusarium-horizontal-transfers).

- **Autumn 2024:** [New opinion article published in Trends in Plant Science](https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(24)00113-4)
in which we argue that, as in crop plants, some types of DNA methylation in trees can induce phenotypic changes, including changes in climate-relevant traits. This follows recent findings in a few tree species that show phenotypic change following DNA methylation of promoter regions upstream of genes. 

- **Autumn 2024:** Invited to give a departmental seminar in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology here at UCLA.

- **Summer 2024:** Gave a talk in the Adaptive Epigenetics session at the 3rd Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology meeting in Montr√©al: "Can DNA methylation help us understand climate adaptation in trees?"

- **Summer 2024:** The Lake Wildfire erupted in the Santa Ynez Valley, where the UC Sedgwick Reserve is located, a long-term oak study site for the Sork lab. We went up as a lab the week following the fire, and I returned after a month to measure physiological traits of burnt and un-burnt trees... watch this space!
