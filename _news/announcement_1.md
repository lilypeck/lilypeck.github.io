Went to Botany 2025 in Palm Springs with the other members of the Sork lab, where we all either presented a poster or gave a talk 🙌🏼. Was inspired by some amazing work ranging from carbon transport in leaves to pangenomes, and gave two talks myself, one about the ecophysiological response to wildfire in mature oak trees, and the other about changes to the DNA methylome following drought stress in oak seedlings!
