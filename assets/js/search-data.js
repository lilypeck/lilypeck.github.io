In this, I have worked with a range of natural populations and organisms, pathogenic and cheese-making fungi and California oaks. I use whole-genome, methylome, and transcriptome sequence data along with population genomics and comparative phylogenetic approaches, combining historical and ecophysiological data. Through all my research avenues, I have brought creativity and a collaborative nature, leading me to exciting questions and revelations about the mechanisms underlying evolutionary change, and the role of genomic structure in response to environmental stress.",
