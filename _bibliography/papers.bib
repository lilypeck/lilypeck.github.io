  abstract = {Coffee wilt disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium xylarioides, is a vascular wilt disease that has affected coffee production in sub-Saharan Africa over the past century. Today, the disease has two host-specific populations specialising on arabica and robusta coffee crops, which grow at high and low altitude, respectively. Here we test whether adaptation to different temperatures contributes to specialisation of the fungi on each crop. Firstly, climate models show that the severity of the arabica and robusta populations of coffee wilt disease correlates with temperature. The robusta population shows higher peak severity than the arabica population overall, but the latter has greater cold tolerance. Secondly, growth assays of thermal performance of fungal strains in vitro show that, while robusta strains grow faster than arabicas at intermediate temperatures, the arabica strains have higher sporulation and spore germination rates at temperatures below 15ºC. The match between environmental patterns of severity in nature with thermal performance of fungal cultures in the laboratory supports a role for temperature adaptation in specialisation on arabica and robusta coffee. Extrapolating our temperature-models to future climate change predicts that disease severity could decline on average due to increased temperature but could increase in some coffee-growing regions.},

            Coffee is attacked by several highly damaging pests and diseases, which include coffee wilt disease (CWD). Despite a devastating impact in recent years, CWD receives little attention and its importance is downplayed or simply ignored. Memories are short and knowledge of past outbreaks fragmentary. Nearly two decades after the last major outbreaks, CWD has quietly faded into the background. This review describes a series of outbreaks of CWD across Africa, from Uganda to Guinea, from the first discovery in the 1920s to a hugely damaging recurrence that began in the 1970s and lasted through to the 2000s. This second wave had devastating impacts on growers and communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Uganda. This review examines the origins of the disease, how and why it spread, and attempts to manage the outbreaks. Recent work on new pathogen variants is also considered. This review aims to recount these events and to evaluate the strategic successes and failures at national, regional and international levels in tackling the second wave of CWD.},

              The first microbial culture collection was established in 1890, and subsequently, over the course of the twentieth century, the number of culture collections grew substantially. One such collection was the CABI-IMI Genetic Resources Collection, informally initiated at the origins of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute in 1920 and established as a UK National Collection in 1947. Its holdings reflect the activities of CABI in agriculture and the environment. Like many collections, it was originally established as a taxonomic reference resource. Over the years, deposits have included strains isolated from disease outbreaks in major crops from all parts of the world. Recent developments in genome sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis have opened up the potential to characterise historic strains to shed more insights on their biology and evolution. In this paper we describe how the resources held within the CABI-IMI culture collection have helped track the emergence and divergence of
              Fusarium xylarioides
              , the coffee wilt pathogen, with a specific focus on the evolution of pathogenicity. Such studies illustrate the value held within the world’s culture collections—their importance in underpinning science and developing our understanding and evolution of plant diseases as well as how the impact of disease can be mitigated in response to climate change, in order to increase yields and feed the world’s burgeoning population.},
